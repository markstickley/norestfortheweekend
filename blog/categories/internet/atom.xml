    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good question, and something I’ve often wondered. You hear people using both terms the whole time so let’s lay this one to rest.</p>

<p>So I’m sitting in this café writing some code and probably looking like a bit of a geek. Fair enough, that happens. For various reasons I want to have a variable in my webapp’s registry that stores the URL of the current page. Or is it URI? I’m at a bit of a loss on what to call it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-url">What is a URL?</h2>

<p>URL stands for <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em> which means it’s a reference to a specific <em>location</em>. Importantly the location must be on the web, although this isn’t indicated within it’s name. More </p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-uri">What is a URI?</h2>

<p>In relation to a URL <strong>a URI is like a superclass</strong>. It stands for <em>Uniform Resource Identifier</em> which means it’s a reference to a specific <em>thing</em>. This thing could be just about anything addressable. For example a location on the web!</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-difference-really-why-dont-we-just-use-url">What’s the difference really? Why don’t we just use URL?</h2>

<p>We should do if we are talking about web addresses! The distinction is that a URL provides information on how to get to the resource (Eg. http, https, ftp, mailto, etc). A URI can be relative (Eg. /path/to/file.jpg) or missing the protocol (Eg. //www.norestfortheweekend.com/2009/). These are both valid URIs but not URLs.</p>

<h2 id="hidden-extras">Hidden Extras</h2>

<p>A URL <em>is a</em> URI but a URI <em>is not necessarily</em> a URL. We see this kind of relationship in programming with classes. Another ‘subclass’ of URI which not as many people have heard of is the URN.</p>

<p>URNs (Uniform Resource Name) start with <code>urn:</code> followed by a string identifying something. They are used for identification purposes rather than as a way of finding (locating) things as URLs are. Something that has some kind of universal identifier can be formatted as a URN. A good example of this is books. The majority of books at retail have an <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr>. The <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr> is their universal identifier; it doesn’t point to where you can find the book, or contain any of the books subject matter. It just identifies it in a way that there is no confusion as to what you’re talking about. </p>

<p>An <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr> can be expressed as a URN: <code>urn:isbn:1582408181</code>.</p>

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

<p>For more wordy explanations, check out the wikipedia articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">URLs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name">URNs</a>!</p>
