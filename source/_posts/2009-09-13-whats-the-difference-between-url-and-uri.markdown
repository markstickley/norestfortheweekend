Good question, and something I've often wondered. You hear people using both terms the whole time so let's lay this one to rest.




So I'm sitting in this caf√© writing some code and probably looking like a bit of a geek. Fair enough, th[viagra](http://atlantic-drugs.net/products/viagra.htm) happens. For various reasons I want to [have](http://cvsmailorderpharmacy.org/buy-kamagra-usa.html) a variable in my webapp's registry that stores the URL of the current page. Or is it URI? I'm at a bit of a loss on what to call it.




#### What is a URL?




URL stands for _Uniform Resource Locator_ which means it's a reference to a specific _location_. Importantly the location must be on the web, although this isn't indicated within it's name. More 




#### What is a URI?




In relation to a URL**a URI is like a superclass**. It stands for _Uniform Resource Identifier_ which means it's a reference to a specific _thing_. This thing could be just about anything addressable. For example a location on the web!




#### What's the difference really? Why don't we just use URL?




We should do if we are talking about web addresses! The distinction is that a URL provides information on how to get to the resource (Eg. http, https, ftp, mailto, etc). A URI can be relative (Eg. /path/to/file.jpg) or missing the protocol (Eg. //www.norestfortheweekend.com/2009/). These are both valid URIs but not URLs.




#### Hidden Extras




A URL _is a _ URI but a URI _is not necessarily_ a URL. We see this kind of relationship in programming with classes. Another 'subclass' of URI which not as many people have heard of is the URN.




URNs (Uniform Resource Name) start with `urn:` followed by a string identifying something. They are used for identification purposes rather than as a way of finding (locating) things as URLs are. Something that has some kind of universal identifier can be formatted as a URN. A good example of this is books. The majority of books at retail have an ISBN. The ISBN is their universal identifier; it doesn't point to where you can find the book, or contain any of the books subject matter. It just identifies it in a way that there is no confusion as to what you're talking about. 




An ISBN can be expressed as a URN: `urn:isbn:1582408181`.




For more wordy explanations, check out the wikipedia articles on [URIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier), [URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator) and [URNs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name)!
