I was asked recently who (in a Web Development context) is good to follow on Twitter. While this is in no way an exhaustive list, this is who I am following and recommend for good quality or interesting tweets.

In no particular order:

@[mattb](http://twitter.com/mattb) (Matt Biddulph)
@[drewm](http://twitter.com/drewm) (Drew McLellan)
@[zeldman](http://twitter.com/zeldman) (Jeffrey Zeldman)
@[boagworld](http://twitter.com/boagworld) (Paul Boag)
@[plasticbaguk](http://twitter.com/plasticbaguk) (Tom Coates)
@[gruber](http://twitter.com/gruber) (John Gruber)
@[simplebits](http://twitter.com/simplebits) (Dan Cederholm)
@[shauninman](http://twitter.com/shauninman) (Shaun Inman)
@[adactio](http://twitter.com/adactio) (Jeremy Keith)

I should mention that (apparently unlike most people) I read all the tweets that come in on my stream. This means that I am less likely to be following people who, while very relevant are also a wee bit too verbose (for my tastes - your mileage may vary) on topics that I didn't follow them for! I won't name names as I don't want to upset anyone.

Please comment and let me know who I missed...
