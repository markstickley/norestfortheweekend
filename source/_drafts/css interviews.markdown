The other day I was kind of dropped in it when my boss asked me to interview a potential new recruit. Now that wouldn't be so bad except this was at about 5pm and the interview was at 11 the next morning. Oh and I'd never interviewed anyone before so... um... little bit nervous. OK, probably more nervous than I was when I was being the one interviewed!

I was told that the role was for a short contract to show a little love to our badly neglected CSS file and both tidy it up while making sure the styles were accurate to the designs, plus a few tweaks here and there. So basically they had to be fluent in CSS-ese. When faced with a challenge like this, I did what any other self-respecting geek would do and crowdsourced it on Twitter.

Some brilliant people came to my rescue almost immediately and here are their responses:
