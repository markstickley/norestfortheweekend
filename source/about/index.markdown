No Rest For The Weekend is a blog containing musings and thoughts on web development and any other topics that may seem vaguely related at the time of writing. 

It is written and maintained by [Mark Stickley](http://www.markstickley.co.uk) who, for a large chunk of his waking life, works at the BBC in London. (The views expressed in this blog do not necessarily reflect the views of the BBC, other blogs are available, etc.)

If you would like to berate him, or contact him for another less predictable reason, please feel free to email. My name is mark and I have an email account at this domain. I'll leave the rest up to you!
