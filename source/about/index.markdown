No Rest For The Weekend is a blog containing musings and thoughts on web development and other (probably technical and/or very geeky) topics that seem vaguely interesting.

It is written and maintained by me, [Mark Stickley](http://www.markstickley.co.uk). For a large chunk of my waking life I earn my crust as a Web Developer in London. 

* If you would like to praise me, hire me, send me money or just talk to me, please email my name (all one word, no spaces) AT [theyakshack.co.uk](http://www.theyakshack.co.uk).
* If you would like to berate me, bill me, serve me with legal notices or sell me discount pharmacuticals please feel free to email fakefakefake@fakestdomainever.com.

Thanks for reading!
