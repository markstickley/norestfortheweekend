  <div class="entry-content"><p>One day in my previous job I was kind of dropped in it when my boss asked me at about 5pm to interview a potential new recruit at 11am the next day. I’d never been on that side of the table in an interview before. Considering how long I had got to prepare I was understandably a little nervous - and for good reason. When you’re interviewing, not only do you have to display an excellent knowledge of the topics you are discussing but you also have to assess whether the person you are talking to possesses that same knowledge. If you do not do this well you are either rejecting a good candidate (which is bad) or hiring a bad one (which is worse).</p>

<p>I was told that the role was for a short contract and the successful candidate would be showing a little love to our badly neglected CSS, both tidying it up while also making sure the styles were rendering accurately according to the designs (plus a few extra tweaks here and there). So basically they had to be fluent in CSS-ese.</p>

<h2 id="twitter-saves-the-day-again">Twitter saves the day again</h2>

<p>When faced with a daunting task such as this, I did what any other self-respecting geek would do and turned to the all-knowing masses on Twitter.</p>

<p>Some brilliant people came to my rescue almost immediately and here are their responses:</p>

<!-- "spell 'specificity' (and then explain it...)" -@rich13 -->
<div class="embed tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/markstickley">markstickley</a> &#8220;spell &#8216;specificity&#8217; (and then explain it&#8230;)&#8221;</p>&mdash; Richard Northover (@rich13) <a href="https://twitter.com/rich13/status/200628477991464961">May 10, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p>I like this one because it’s really getting back to basics. Not only do you have to know that specificity exists but you have to understand what it does and how it does it. The spelling part is a bit of fun - hopefully the candidate will understand that that’s not the important part! Here’s <a href="http://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/">an article on CSS specificity</a> if you need a refresher.</p>

<!-- I got asked the difference between display:none; and visibility:hidden -@mfujica -->
<div class="embed tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/markstickley">markstickley</a> I got asked the difference between display:none; and visibility:hidden - but that&#8217;s years ago&#8230;</p>&mdash; Morena Fiore (@mfujica) <a href="https://twitter.com/mfujica/status/200629821737406465">May 10, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p>This is a nice one as well. It checks that they have some understanding about how the document flow works. You could follow this question up by asking if they know any other ways of hiding content and why they might want to do it that way instead.</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that <code>display: none</code> removes the element from the document flow while <code>visibility: hidden</code> does not. Another way of hiding content (which is good for accessibility as it doesn’t hide it from screen readers) is by using a negative margin. There are various drawbacks and other ways of achieveing this which might also be a good thing to discuss.</p>

<!-- What is the default position of an element? -@mfujica -->
<div class="embed tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/markstickley">markstickley</a> What is the default position of an element?</p>&mdash; Morena Fiore (@mfujica) <a href="https://twitter.com/mfujica/status/200630440720220160">May 10, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p>It is <code>static</code>. But it’s not the most well-known property as normally we are changing the position <em>from</em> <code>static</code> <em>to</em> something else, like <code>relative</code> or <code>fixed</code>.</p>

<!-- Explaning what inline-block is also should be a good -@mfujica -->
<div class="embed tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/markstickley">markstickley</a> Explaning what inline-block is also should be a good question&#8230;</p>&mdash; Morena Fiore (@mfujica) <a href="https://twitter.com/mfujica/status/200631684956299266">May 10, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p><code>inline-block</code> has only really been useful since IE started supporting it properly (around v8) and so while it’s very handy, not everyone has used it.</p>

<p>An element with <code>display: inline-block</code> flows in the document like an inline element but allows you to apply styles to it that normally only apply to block-level elements such as <code>margin</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.</p>

<!-- what is CSS3? Draw an arrow head using borders. -@ralfas -->
<div class="embed tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/markstickley">markstickley</a> what is CSS3? Draw an arrow head using borders.</p>&mdash; Ralfas Jegorovas (@ralfas) <a href="https://twitter.com/ralfas/status/200843040892518400">May 11, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>I expect most candidates would ask for clarification or look confused at the first part of that question. That’s fine, seeing their reaction allows you to gauge the way they might react to a poorly defined spec, for example. It’s kind of open ended so they might simple say “It’s the latest version of CSS”. Others may list a few new features. If they’re really smart they’ll tell you that CSS3 hasn’t been formally specified because it’s still in development.</p>

<p>Drawing an arrowhead with borders requires the knowledge that when fat borders meet on adjecent edges they form a diagonal. Check out <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/22/css-quick-tip-css-arrows-and-shapes-without-markup/">this article</a> for more details. Alternatively you can ask them to <a href="/blog/2012/07/11/zero-image-close-buttons/">create a close button with pure CSS</a> if you’re feeling mean!</p>

<p>Yep :)</p>

<h2 id="other-ideas">Other ideas</h2>

<h3 id="vendor-prefixes">Vendor prefixes</h3>

<p>I quite like an open ended question, particularly if it calls for some opinion. A lot of this industry is based on facts and rigid concepts that are either right or wrong so hearing someone’s opinion and their ability to express it well could be the difference between a hire and a no-hire.</p>

<p>Simply ask them to explain vendor prefixes, what they’re for and importantly whether they think they are a good idea, making sure to push them for both positive and negative points).</p>

<h3 id="box-model">Box model</h3>

<p>Get them to explain <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/box_model">the box model</a> to you. You’re looking for a good understanding of the different parts that come into play, particularly how it can affect how wide an element will be (and how it won’t always be the same width as its <code>width</code> value). This conversation can then lead onto <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/box-sizing">the <code>box-sizing</code> property</a> introduced in CSS3. See if they know the default value for all element (<code>content-box</code>) and for bonus points see if they know which mode IE uses in Quirks Mode (<code>border-box</code>).</p>

<h3 id="scss">SCSS</h3>

<p>Of course these days CSS isn’t quite as static as it used to be with code generators like <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">less</a> becoming more and more popular. You can ask if they know about these technologies (and what they think of them). If you’re using one in your business, you should probably have a few specific questions about it as well ;)</p>

<p>In favour of CSS generation, it is nice to be able to use a <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> methodology through mixins and inheritance, and it’s even better to be able to define things once and use them many times throughout the document (like colours). Against it, the code generated can be quite verbose and it’s typically hard to debug as looking at the compiled code gives you no indication where a rule exists (or was generated from) in the source.</p>

<h3 id="implement-something-with-no-classes-or-ids">Implement {something} with no classes or ids</h3>

<p>Finally, get them to code up some HTML and CSS for a small interface element (Eg. a tweet (including all the meta data around it)) but do it <strong>without using classes or ids</strong>. Ask them to use HTML5 and to use semantically relevant tags.</p>

<p>This task can take a while but it shows a lot about their thinking process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It shows they have a knowledge of HTML5 tags and semantic markup</li>
  <li>It forces them to improvise with the use of CSS selectors</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many under-used selectors out there which would be perfect for this sort of task. Just <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#selectors">look at them</a>! Do you know all of them? I know I don’t, certainly not without looking. If you really wanted to test just their CSS skills then you could write the HTML for them in a way that would force them to use specific selectors. The sky really is the limit here… get creative!</p>

<h2 id="any-more">Any more?</h2>

<p>If you’ve got any favourites (and I’m sure you have, whether they’re questions you use or have had used on you), please stick them in the comments. I’d be really interested to hear them!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving#Noun">shaving yaks</a> recently, I came across and interface element in our product: a tiny button that removed an item from a list. The button was just a simple circle with an X through it.</p>

<p>Originally it had been created by hiding the text of a link, using the <code>:before</code> selector and the <code>content</code> property to add an X and then styling it. It wasn’t ideal because it never really lined up properly, especially when the font size changed and <em>especially</em> if the font family was changed. I wanted to find a better way.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-gradient-as-a-gradient-is-so-overrated">Using a gradient as a gradient is so overrated</h2>

<p>You can create a much better X with a few gradients! In fact, gradient backgrounds, multiple background images and rounded corners give you pretty much all the tools you need to create the <strong>best X button ever</strong>. You just have to realise that just because it’s called a gradient it doesn’t have to look like one.</p>

<p>There are two ways of doing this, but I’ll start with the simplest. Let’s deconstruct our button:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/07/11/zero-image-close-buttons/simple-breakdown.png" width="514" height="195" title="'The X is just two lines'" /></p>

<p>As a single linear gradient can only make lines parallel to each other, we need to make two lines by using two gradients.</p>

<p>By placing two colour stops of differing colours right next to each other we create a solid transition between colours instead of a gradient.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-level">The next level</h2>

<p>The above approach is a bit limited. A couple of problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to change the background or to leave it transparent, BUT what if we want the background to have a solid colour and have the X transparent, letting the colour or image behind show through? It doesn’t work.</li>
  <li>With one line of the X overlaid on the other it would be impossible to give the lines of the X a gradient with any kind of rotational symmetry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both these problems can be solved by deconstructing the X a little further:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/07/11/zero-image-close-buttons/advanced-breakdown.png" width="200" height="200" title="'The X is four lines joining at the centre'" /></p>

<p>This means as well as creating four gradients we must also give them each different positions within the element they apply to.</p>

<h2 id="thats-a-bit-fancy">That’s a bit fancy</h2>

<p>Now that each ‘spoke’ of the X is created by a separate gradient, we can get super-fancy and create effects like <a href="/demos/zero-image-close-buttons/fancy1.html">this</a>, <a href="/demos/zero-image-close-buttons/fancy2.html">this</a> and <a href="/demos/zero-image-close-buttons/fancy3.html">this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-sassy">Getting SASSy</h2>

<p>It only seems right that all this goodness should be rolled into a simple-to-use SCSS mixin. Copy and paste this code and create close buttons as easily as typing <code>@include XBackground($foreground: white, $background: gray, $width: 34%)</code> (adding your own <code>border</code> and <code>border-radius</code> as required).</p>

<h2 id="vendor-schmendor">Vendor schmendor</h2>

<p>Looking again at <a href="/demos/zero-image-close-buttons/advanced.html">the CSS of the more advanced solution</a>, it turns out that there’s quite a lot of it. This is thanks to all the variations and vendor prefixes we have to use (THANKS FOR THAT VENDORS).</p>

<p>Of course another way we could do this is just to use an image. <em>Old school</em>. We can base64 encode and include it directly in the CSS. While doing that makes it a little larger than a separate file it cuts out the overhead of an extra request so it should be quicker overall.</p>

<p><a href="/demos/zero-image-close-buttons/base64.html">Here</a>’s the base64 version in action. View source and you’ll see that it’s a lot smaller (about half the size) of the gradient-based solution. The gradient version will scale to any size but if you use it at a fixed size is it worth the extra bandwidth?</p>

<p>Fortunately you don’t need to make that choice! Here’s a handy little chart explaining why:</p>

<table class="display">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<td class="unused" />
			<th>Chars</th>
			<th>Uncompressed</th>
			<th>Gzipped</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Gradients</th>
			<td>3969</td>
			<td>3.84KB</td>
			<td>313 bytes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Base64 image</th>
			<td>1961</td>
			<td>1.91KB</td>
			<td>1.33KB</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>And you <em>are</em> gzipping all your stuff as you serve it, right? I thought so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My Wordpress install kept disabling all the plugins. No idea why. Because I don’t browse my own blog too regularly (especially with the regularity of posts I’ve been writing recently) the only indication I had was when I started getting lots of spam comments thanks to the lack of <a href="http://akismet.com/">Askimet</a>.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.twitter.com/elduderino78">a colleague</a> mentioned Wordpress recently, in particular how he would never use it in a million years, I asked what he would use instead thinking perhaps something like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://www.posterous.com">Posterous</a> or something similar. Instead, he suggested something decidedly more… <em>fishy</em>.</p>

<h2 id="octopress">Octopress</h2>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is a very neat little blogging environment. You write your posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> and then run a little rake script to generate your blog. The files generated are static HTML files which is great for performance and caching.</p>

<p>The blog’s structure is generated from templates and the CSS is generated using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> so you get all the benefits of a dynamically generated site but none of the overheads. As if that wasn’t awesome enough, it’s virtually seamlessly integrated with GitHub and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, so you write locally, generate and then deploy with another rake script.</p>

<h2 id="migrating-from-wordpress">Migrating from Wordpress</h2>

<p>To get all my stuff out of Wordpress I used Wordpress’ own export function to generate an XML document of all the posts and metadata. Then I used <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a> to convert the XML to markdown, which worked OK. That converted everything except comments. Generating static files means that comments are not really possible natively but Octopress has built in support for <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> which works seamlessly. This does mean that the old comments are lost but you know what they say: you can’t make a seafood paella without chopping up a few octopi.</p>

<p>It wasn’t all plain sailing though.</p>

<h2 id="this-almost-seems-like-work">This almost seems like work</h2>

<p>I noticed as I clicked through some of the generated markdown files that some scamp had been at my articles and inserted spam links directly into the articles! Honestly, I was getting more and more glad to be moving from Wordpress by the minute. This did mean I had to read each of them through to make sure there wasn’t anything in there I didn’t want. </p>

<p>Reading through your old blog posts is hard. There’s stuff that doesn’t matter any more, there’s stuff that’s just plain inaccurate, there’s stuff which sounds really goofy reading back 3 years later. I tried my hardest not to change the content in them and for the most part I managed for historical reasons to preserve it.</p>

<p>As I was going through each article I adjusted the formatting of the markdown making sure the heading level was correct, the line spacing was correct, the code correctly marked down etc. All the usual OCD stuff that needs doing once you know it’s there.</p>

<p>I had been using a plugin to handle media on Wordpress so images were kind of messed up and I had to copy all the images and reformat all the image tags by hand. I was so glad I hadn’t written all that many articles! Keeping it really simple in markdown seems so sensible I can’t believe we didn’t always blog like this.</p>

<p>The last thing that needed doing was to give it more of the look and feel of the old site. The default theme, <em>classic</em>, is very nice but I’m rather fond of that little pixel dude in the header. Plus I got to try out a friend’s clever <a href="http://glan.github.com/CSS-Patterns-Workbench/">CSS Patterns Workbench</a> to create the background in pure CSS instead of images.</p>

<h2 id="cname-cname-run">CNAME. CNAME RUN.</h2>

<p>One last awesome thing: GitHub Pages support domains. By setting your CNAME to point at the page (or the A tag if it’s the whole domain, not just a subdomain) you can point your site to GitHub Pages and have the whole thing hosted for free, no bandwidth charges or anything. I love you GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>

<p>I’m so glad I’m not using WordPress anymore. Wordpress blogs are such a target for hackers and spammers and I was hit several times over. I tended to keep fairly on top of the updates as well, so you can image how bad it might be for people who don’t bother. If anyone wants to hack this blog now they have to hack my GitHub account. Of course having <a href="https://github.com/markstickley/norestfortheweekend">the whole blog on GitHub</a> has its advantages too… if you like you can correct any mistakes or typos by submitting a pull request!</p>

Since the browser is now available and that post is easily the post that has drawn the most attention to my humble blog I thought it would be worth writing a quick follow-up.</p>

<h3 id="not-letting-you-down-easily">Not letting you down easily</h3>

<p>There’s no way of saying this easily: the browser kind of sucks.</p>

<p>I’ve never found browsing on a console a particularly satisfying experience and I didn’t expect this to be any better. What excited me was the potential for extending the web into a new dimension. The browser doesn’t even do that. It’s nowhere near as awesome as I’d hoped. No 3D, no custom CSS extensions. It ‘does’ 3D… sort of. You can link to .mpo 3D image files; it’ll display them in 3D and allow you to save them to the SD card. It does not display the images in 3D inline in the page, though, and the 3D capabilities doesn’t extend beyond image files to other page elements.</p>

<p>Viewing 3D photos on the web is pretty cool though, I’ll admit. If you want to try out viewing 3D pictures on the web for yourself, head over to <a href="http://www.3dporch.com">3D Porch</a> where they have stacks of them waiting to be seen.</p>

<p>Interestingly, because .mpo and .jpg are both encoded using the standard jpeg format it seems that you can use them both in the same way. If you visit <a href="/demos/3ds-browser-revisited/3ds-mpo.html">this little demo page I put together</a> you can see that most browsers are happy displaying .mpo files natively as well as .mpo files renamed as .jpgs. The 3DS browser will display both images on the page without a problem. Sadly they are in 2D, although if you click on them (they are linked to their original files) then the image is shown in 3D. This works for both the .mpo file and the .mpo renamed as a .jpg.</p>

<p>The browser doesn’t have Flash. This is no great loss, however, and with the 3DS’ weak battery life you can’t blame them for not wanting to include something that would drain it even more quickly than in most situations.</p>

<h3 id="getting-technical">Getting technical</h3>

<p>For some fairly technical details about the browser, <a href="http://www.3dsbuzz.com/nintendo-3ds-to-use-netfront-browser-supports-flash-and-html5/">3DS Buzz wrote it up at the bottom of this article</a>. I’ll attempt to filter some useful information out of that…</p>

<p>It is claimed that the browser supports HTML5 and CSS3 (partially in both cases). As such it isn’t much of a surprise that it doesn’t pass the <a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/">Acid 3 test</a>. It is more of a surprise, however, that the 3DS does not even pass the <a href="http://acid2.acidtests.org/">Acid 2 test</a>. Don’t expect your pages to render perfectly (I’ve already had reports of pages not looking as they should).</p>

<p>The JavaScript engine is said to be “high speed” but it takes it’s sweet time to finish failing the Acid 3 test.</p>

<iframe width="628" height="628" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ijv5TSGy1wY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Here is the 3DS’ User Agent string:</p>

<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (Nintendo 3DS; U; ; en) Version/1.7412.EU
</code></pre>

<p>This is interesting for several reasons. </p>

<ol>
  <li>It doesn’t list the rendering engine or make any mention of NetFront	</li>
  <li>It DOES list the device name (not really that interesting, it’s just cool to see it)</li>
  <li>It’s fairly concise (it doesn’t come loaded with all the cruft you normally find in a UA string)</li>
  <li>It has the version number, but only for what appears to be the browser and not the system software</li>
</ol>

<p>Compare that UA string with the one of the version of Chrome I’m using right now:</p>

<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_7) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.742.91 Safari/534.30
</code></pre>

<p>Chrome’s is much longer and more verbose. You can see it not only contains the hardware but the system software version. It has the rendering engine and it’s version, the browser and it’s version and for the life of me I can’t think why but it also has a reference to Safari.</p>

<p>What’s odd to me about the 3DS’ UA string is the inclusion of the <code>.EU</code> on the end of the version number, right at the end. Does this mean that there’s an EU version of the browser that’s different from the browser they get in Japan and America? Why would they want to have to maintain multiple versions of the software? Will they use that user agent information to serve different content on Nintendo sites based on region? Probably not (but they could…).</p>

<h3 id="utilitarian">Utilitarian</h3>

<p>While I’m sure it’ll be fine for jumping onto GameFAQs to figure out how to beat that boss you’re stuck on, the 3DS browser is not going to set the world on fire like I hoped it might. I hope that not too many people got their hopes up about it, but if you did (like me) and are now feeling a little disappointed I feel your pain. At least it’s never going to gain a significant enough market share that we’ll ever have to worry about fixing broken sites in it… (famous last words).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well that’s not strictly true. The full headline reads something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Webkit doesn’t fire the <code>load</code> event on images when you change the <code>src</code> attribute and the new <code>src</code> is the same as the old</strong></p>

<h3 id="that-seems-reasonable">That seems reasonable</h3>

<p>That seems like reasonable behaviour. I mean, the image is already loaded. Changing the <code>src</code> attribute to it’s <em>current value</em> isn’t really changing it at all. It’s staying the same. If the <code>src</code> is the same and the image is already loaded, why fire the <code>load</code> event? You would only want to do that if the image was reloaded but doing that would be pointless as it’s already loaded. Loading it again would be a waste of bandwidth and make the experience feel slower; not what browser manufacturers are aiming for.</p>

<p>So what’s the big deal?</p>

<h3 id="inherently-lazy">Inherently lazy</h3>

<p>Developers like myself are inherently lazy. I don’t mean we’re workshy, but rather we always look for the easiest, cleanest solution to problems. This behaviour in WebKit fails twice on this count.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s inconsistent with other browsers. I have to work around it, potentially adding browser-specific code. That’s not good.</li>
  <li>It forces me to add extra code to cope with it’s specific requirements. Let me explain:</li>
</ol>

<p>If I was writing for a JS-guaranteed environment this wouldn’t be such a problem but I’m a conscientious sort of guy and realise that not everyone will have the benefits of a modern browser with all the options set to ‘awesome’. I want to cater for the JS-disadvantaged as well.</p>

<p>Let’s assume I’m writing a carousel for a photo slideshow that shows 4 pictures at a time. I want to show the first 4 pictures by default so that at least some content appears even for the non-JS users. Then, using non-intrusive JS I augment the slideshow to add next / previous buttons and the ability to click the image to enlarge it in a lightbox.</p>

<p>To avoid repeating a lot of code in a setup function that would also be present in the next/previous function I can write a single function to set the page of the carousel, setting up the images and their click events.</p>

<p>I’m using <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a href="http://fancybox.net/">Fancybox</a> for this example.</p>

<p>So what we have there is a function that loops over the four <code>img</code> tags, pulls information out of an array (<code>carouseldata</code>) based on the page offset passed as an argument, sets up click and load listeners and changes the image’s <code>src</code> attribute. This will work for any page at any time. In theory we could add a ‘jump to page’ option where the user could choose the page number to skip to. But we won’t.</p>

<p>This is especially handy as we can simply call <code>loadGalleryCarouselPage(0);</code> to set up the event listeners when the page first loads without having to duplicate most of the lines elsewhere. We even get a natty little loading spinner if we take advantage of the <code>loading</code> class that is set.</p>

<h3 id="making-things-difficult">Making things difficult</h3>

<p>When the page loads it’s a bit of a race. The results of this function varies between refreshes for me. If the image has not yet loaded when the JS runs then it works fine. If the image has already loaded, however, here’s what happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <code>load</code> event listener is set	</li>
  <li>The <code>loading</code> class is applied which shows a spinner and hides the image</li>
  <li>The <code>src</code> of the <code>img</code> is set</li>
  <li>The <code>load</code> event DOES NOT FIRE in WebKit because the image is already loaded</li>
  <li>The picture remains hidden and the spinner keeps spinning even though the image is loaded</li>
</ol>

<p>And that is frustrating.</p>

<p>It’s an intermittent problem though, only when loading race conditions fail. Here’s another situation where it happens every time.</p>

<h3 id="the-dead-cert">The dead cert.</h3>

<p>The total number of images in the carousel doesn’t divide perfectly by four, so on the final page there are only two images showing. The final two of the four <code>img</code> elements are hidden from view. They are hidden rather than removed because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They act as spacers so that other elements flow around them correctly</li>
  <li>The <code>img</code> tag needs to stay so that we can easily change the <code>src</code> attribute if the user navigates back to a page with 4 images on it.</li>
</ol>

<p>So say we’re on page 9 of 10 and click ‘Next’. Images 1 &amp; 2 are updated to show the final two pictures and images 3 &amp; 4 are hidden. Importantly: the <code>src</code> attributes of images 3 &amp; 4 don’t change. When we click ‘Previous’, images 1 &amp; 2 are changed back but 3 &amp; 4 are stuck with the loading spinner. That’s because, like before, the <code>src</code> was already set and it was equal to the new value.</p>

<h3 id="working-around-it">Working around it</h3>

<p>We could set the hidden images to a transparent .gif or .png instead of hiding them which would solve the second problem but because we want the images showing for non-JS users when the page loads we can’t use that technique to fix this. Also, downloading that extra image means extra bandwidth and latency times that we’d rather not have to deal with.</p>

<p>It turns out that setting the <code>src</code> to <code>''</code> (empty string) immediately before setting the image url will fix the problem. But! It causes the images (and consequently their container) to collapse to zero width and height in Firefox while the new images are loading which looks really bad if you’re trying to navigate a slideshow.</p>

<p>Here’s my solution:</p>

<p>I added an <code>else</code> so that if there aren’t enough pictures to fill all the <code>img</code> tags the <code>src</code> of the unused images is set to an empty string. There will always be at least one image on each page so there will always be an image at full height to prop up the carousel container while those hidden <code>img</code> tags are primed to receive more content.</p>

<p>I also added a little <code>if</code> block directly before initialising the carousel, at the bottom. If the browser is webkit-powered then it’ll loop over the <code>img</code> tags and prime them (set their <code>src</code> to empty) before initialisation. Because this is done using JS, non-JS users will still see the images.</p>

<h3 id="grumpy">Grumpy</h3>

<p>I’m grumpy about having to put in that extra, browser specific code. Setting the <code>src</code> to an empty string seems hacky. But it works and the logic is still clean and minimal. So it’ll do.</p>

<p>I hope that helps anyone having image loading javascript issues. And as usual I’d be interested to hear if you have any alternative / better solutions!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know how, according to the W3C, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#parsing-errors">CSS selectors that are not understood should be ignored, without error</a>? IE7 doesn’t do that 100% of the time.</p>

<h3 id="how-dare-it">How dare it</h3>

<p>That’s right. Just when you thought you had a nice system in place IE comes along and stomps all over it. I’m sure more and more people will come up against this as they start using CSS gradients in earnest. I can see it being quite a common situation, too. I have two background images: one, a CSS generated gradient and two, an image to be laid over the top of it. A nice shiny button with an icon, for example.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/button.png" width="142" height="38" title="'A button that says Register now and has a gradient and a separate icon for the background'" /></p>

<p>We know that certain browsers can’t render gradients and so we define the background to initially be just a solid colour with the icon image (the users of the older browsers will never miss what they didn’t know was there). Then we go on to define the styles for the modern browsers. These styles use the same selector (<code>background-image</code>) so they will override the initial declaration but according to the rules, browsers that don’t understand the gradient instructions will just ignore the whole declaration leaving us with just the initial icon for the background.</p>

<p>As we know, the backgrounds will appear top down from the order you specify them so we specify the icon first and then the gradient, otherwise the gradient would obscure the icon.</p>

<p>We also define the background-position twice. This is so we can position the gradient+icon background differently from the icon on it’s own. Browsers that don’t support multiple backgrounds should not see this syntax as valid and should ignore it.</p>

<p>Here’s the code:</p>

<p>Here it is in Firefox:  </p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example1-ff.png" width="142" height="38" title="'Styles are working well in Firefox'" /></p>

<p>And in IE7:  </p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example1-ie.png" width="142" height="38" title="'The icon on the button is missing in IE'" /></p>

<p>Or you can <a href="/demos/css3-gradients-multiple-backgrounds-and-ie7/example1.html">see it for yourself in your browser</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that IE is not behaving as we might expect. It’s not showing the gradient (expected) but it’s not failing back to just showing the icon either. A quick look at the IE developer toolbar (in IE9, IE7 mode; the IE7 dev toolbar would leave you stumped) shows us why:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example1-ie-inspector.png" width="692" height="100" title="'Screenshot of the IE developer toolbar showing that IE has picked up and is trying to use styles it can't understand'" /></p>

<p>It’s picked up the background image declaration that includes a gradient. In this case it’s the Mozilla-specific gradient and the reason it’s this one and not the Webkit one is that we are defining the Mozilla one last. If they were defined the other way around it would have picked up the Webkit one instead.</p>

<h3 id="why-oh-why">Why? Oh why??</h3>

<p>I’m no expert on how IE parses CSS but I would presume it’s something like IE recognises the URL part just fine and when it reaches the closing parenthesis it figures that’s it and all’s well. Maybe not. Whatever, for some reason it thinks it’s a valid declaration, scoops up the whole lot gradient and all and tries to render it. And fails.</p>

<h3 id="thats-annoying">That’s annoying</h3>

<p>Yes it is.</p>

<h3 id="the-fix">The fix</h3>

<p>Importantly, IE correctly recognises the <code>background-image</code> declaration as invalid (for itself) if it starts with a gradient, even if it contains a regular image later on. So we just start the declaration with a gradient. The trouble is, we don’t want to put the gradient first as it’ll obscure the icon, so we define <em>another</em> gradient that is OK to put on top of the icon. That would be an empty or transparent gradient.</p>

<p>We will use the minimum amount of code that is necessary to trigger a gradient in the rendering engine. For Webkit, it is <code>-webkit-gradient(linear, left bottom, left top)</code>. No <code>color-stop</code>s required. This is good because no colour means no visible gradient. For Mozilla, it requires some colour information, so we just give it completely transparent colours using <code>rgba</code>: <code>-moz-linear-gradient(center bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%)</code>.</p>

<p>Putting these gradients first mean that IE7 won’t incorrectly think it can render that style and so it’ll stick with just the icon.</p>

<p><strong>Important: Because we now have 3 background images, we also need to declare a third value for background-position.</strong></p>

<h3 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there’s more!</h3>

<p>You thought this was over? Of course it’s not! IE9 is a heck of a lot better than previous versions but it’s still not perfect. For example, it does support multiple backgrounds but it doesn’t support CSS gradients. This means that it’ll ignore the gradients but it’ll use the <code>background-position</code> multiple background declaration we made, resulting in the icon being positioned <code>left top</code> as opposed to <code>5px center</code>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example2-ie9.png" width="142" height="38" title="'The styles have regressed in IE9 and the icon is incorrectly aligned'" /></p>

<p>I tried getting around this by inserting another <code>background-image</code> defining three images (two of them transparent spacers) directly after the first <code>background-image</code> and before the first gradient:</p>

<p>But that didn’t work as IE7 still parsed it (incorrectly) just as it did in the first instance and therefore didn’t show the icon at all. Back to square one.</p>

<p>At this point I’m sure most people are thinking</p>

<p>“Oh come on, why not just use <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> and only apply the gradients to browsers that can use them?”</p>

<p>That’s one way of doing it, although I would rather not use JavaScript if possible. This leaves one option… go back to the original CSS and add this conditional comment in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>

<p>As no versions of IE yet support gradients, we just reset the background to be the plain ol’ icon. Problem solved.</p>

<p>Here it is in Firefox:  </p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example3-ff.png" width="142" height="38" title="'The styles are working well in Firefox'" /></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example3-op.png" width="142" height="38" title="'The styles are working well in Opera'" /></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example3-ie6.png" width="142" height="38" title="'The styles are working well in IE6'" /></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/example3-ie8.png" width="142" height="38" title="'The styles are working well in IE8'" /></p>

<p>And in IE9:  </p>

<h3 id="a-side-serving-of-gradient">A side serving of gradient</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that two of the <code>color-stop</code>s have the same percentage/distance value. This effectively give us the ability to have more than one gradient on the same element. The end result is a gradient from the top to the middle, a sudden stop and change of colour and another gradient from the middle to the bottom. It’s useful to be able to change sharply from one colour to another as well as smoothly!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Sunday my wife and I went and had a sneaky preview of the new games console from Nintendo: the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/3ds">3DS</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/nintendo3dswithpen.png" width="455" height="384" title="'The Nintendo 3DS'" /></p>

<p>Let’s not beat around the bush: this is a very impressive device. It’s tricked out with all the latest technologies (or the latest applications of ‘old’ technologies, wherever you choose to draw the line). The thing people are really talking about, of course, is the 3D aspect of it. I’m sure you have read about it - the top screen is a 3D display which importantly doesn’t require glasses. I can’t stress enough how good the 3D effect looked. It felt completely natural and I didn’t find myself getting any kind of a headache or nausea like some people are worried about.</p>

<p>There were demos available of most of the functionality: Lots of games that’ll be available on launch or shortly thereafter, 3D photography, augmented reality (including the ‘reality’ part shown in 3D due to the 3D cameras on the lid - the most impressive thing for me) and street pass (Nintendo’s social discovery system). But the thing that actually holds the <em>most</em> interest for me <em>wasn’t</em> shown and indeed is barely talked about. I’m hoping that will change.</p>

<h3 id="a-complex-web">A complex web</h3>

<p>I’m talking, of course, about the web browser which will come built in to the device as part of the extensive suit of software bundled on-board.</p>

<p>*YAWN*</p>

<p>A web browser? What’s so great about that?</p>

<p>I don’t know yet because no-one is talking about it, but I’m <em>hoping</em> it will inspire (even more) innovation and creativity on the web. I’m hoping it will have some semblance of 3D integration and capability. And if not, why not? Surely this is the way the web is going. More and more devices will be 3D enabled in the near future and you can bet that if the 3DS doesn’t kick-start the 3D web some other device will. You can buy a 3D TV to put in your living room for crying out loud - this is 2011! They reckon you’ll be able to buy a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9393762.stm">HOLOGRAPHIC 3D TV</a> in 2012. I’m all over that. And I want the web to make sure it isn’t left behind. After all, a lot of modern TVs have integrated browsers. It’s the next logical step.</p>

<h3 id="least-they-could-do">Least they could do</h3>

<p>The least I could hope for is support for 3D images displayed in web pages. The <strong>LEAST</strong>. The standard open format is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats#MPO">.mpo</a> and fortunately <a href="http://nintendo3dsblog.com/the-3d-camera-in-the-nintendo-3ds-saves-photos-in-the-open-mpo-file-format">the same format in which the 3DS saves it’s 3D photos</a>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say you will be able to simply embed the 3D photos in your site and have them work in the 3DS’ web browser though. Think how that would look in a desktop browser… Well it probably wouldn’t show up or show a broken image.</p>

<p>No, no, no, don’t even think about making a separate site for 3D devices. I thought we were past all that. What are you going to have yet another separate site for 3D+Mobile? We want to serve one page that works on all devices.</p>

<p>The trouble is, without images having a similar failover pattern to the one available to <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/everything-you-need-to-know-about-html5-video-and-audio/">video and audio in HTML5</a>, you simply couldn’t use the image inline in your page as non-3D-enabled browsers wouldn’t recognise the format. This just proves that there are always new image formats emerging; they are not all supported by all browsers as it’s easy to assume (if you forget about IE6 and .png’s) so why should we assume that that’s the case with the markup?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2010/why-video-audio-canvas-arent-self-closing-tags/">This has been discussed by Bruce Lawson</a> and makes sense (no matter how frustrating it is). So until all browsers support the display of 3D images on 2D screens we will have to find another way.</p>

<p>The other way to include images in the page is, of course, CSS background images. This one has legs. The 3DS browser could easily respond to an @media query, something like <code>@media screen and (-3ds-min-device-spatial-dimensions: 3) { ... }</code>. Then you could alter how the page looks on a device that has 3D capabilities. Once you have the 3D background image in place you can mark it up to include a 2D version for the rest of the world:</p>

<p>The best of both worlds! We can dream…</p>

<h3 id="reality-check">Reality check</h3>

<p>Before we go on, I just need to make it abundantly clear (if it isn’t already) that this article is pure speculation. I don’t know if the 3DS browser supports any of this kind of stuff, but imagining the possibilities and how they might work is an interesting exercise. Oh wait, it looks like <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/chrome/cadie/">Google has already looked into 3D browsing</a>. My mistake ;)</p>

<p>Let’s explore further down the rabbit hole…</p>

<h3 id="going-the-extra-dimension">Going the extra dimension</h3>

<p>What if we wanted to move beyond just sticking 3D images in our pages? As awesome as a 3D gallery might be, there are so many more possibilities. Imagine if the whole page could be rendered in 3D; if each element on the page had it’s own depth setting. I think the most obvious thing to do would be to push the background actually into the background giving the site content more prominence, and if you start down that road you should just be able to let your imagination carry you forwards.</p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking, and it’s what I thought at first too… why not use <code>z-index</code> for that? The reason why not is because <code>z-index</code> controls the stacking order of elements on a single plane. If you change the function of <code>z-index</code> to control depth on 3D devices, how would you re-order a group of elements sharing the same depth on a 3D page? It’s clear that we need a separate property to do that. I’m going to be bold and use <code>depth</code> in examples, for want of a better attribute name.</p>

<p>So where are we? We’ve got 3D images and the ability to assign <code>depth</code> to elements. That’s a good start, but it seems a little restricted, doesn’t it? A bunch of flat panels sitting at different depths in a 3D space. We’re not really making the most of the technology. We need to add a little style in there… style that can bridge the gap between depth-levels. Fortunately, Webkit is one step ahead of this game with it’s <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/">CSS 3D transforms</a>. These could easily be adapted to show in real 3D instead of 3D rendered in 2D.</p>

<h4 id="curves-would-be-nice">Curves would be nice</h4>

<p>Yes they would, and so would a mansion on the beach in Barbados. We don’t even have the ability to define curves in 2D CSS yet. But then in 2D we might not have wanted to do crazy things like making a callout or title bow inwards or outwards, which would work pretty well in 3D. But maybe just one step at a time…</p>

<h3 id="what-is-3d-anyway">What is 3D anyway</h3>

<p>To develop in 3D you need to understand how it really works. Fortunately understanding it is a lot simpler than getting your head around designing and developing in it:</p>

<p><strong>3D works by each of your eyes seeing a slightly different image.</strong></p>

<p>Simple enough, and in real life this works pretty well. But when generating your own 3D content you have to be ever-mindful of it.</p>

<h3 id="mind-the-gaps">Mind the gaps</h3>

<p>Imagine a blank page. You make the background a fetching pinkish sort of red colour and set the <code>depth</code> to be way back in the distance. </p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/demo1.png" width="628" height="312" title="'3DS Screen showing plain background'" /></p>

<p>You then have a look at it and wonder why it doesn’t look like it’s way off in the distance. You check to see that your 3D depth slider is turned all the way up and when you find that it is you’re left feeling a little confused.</p>

<p>The reason why this doesn’t appear to be in the background is because your eyes are seeing the exact same image. There needs to be some more detail in there before your eyes can be tricked into thinking that it’s way off in the distance. Here are some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You could give it a border that makes it look like you’re looking into a box. Of course the edges of the border would need to be firmly in the foreground for it to work.</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/demo2.png" width="628" height="312" title="'3DS screen showing a background shaded to look like you are looking into a box'" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>You could give it a pattern or image. Beware with repeating patterns though: looking at 3D images forces your eyes to cross slightly and a repeating pattern could cause you to think it’s not at the depth you intended.</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/demo3.png" width="628" height="312" title="'3DS screen with a patterned background'" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Lay something else on top of it with a higher <code>depth</code>. For demonstration purposes I’m going to go with this one.</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/demo4.png" width="628" height="312" title="'3DS screen with a plain background and a green tile overlayed'" /></p>

<p>But even laying something on top like this isn’t too easy for our brains to process. Have a look what each eye would be seeing.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/demo5.png" width="628" height="312" title="'Side-by-side 3DS screens showing the difference in location of the overlaid panel for each eye'" /></p>

<p>There’s not a great deal to differentiate these two images and while your brain knows it’s seeing different things from each eye it is struggling because there are things missing that it’s used to. Usually when you see an object in front of another object it casts a shadow somewhere. Because they are in different locations your eyes will each see that shadow slightly differently. Also the way the object is lit and how it reflects the light could be different in each eye. To make sure we don’t give people headaches we’ll have to sort this out.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>CSS    </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="css"><span class="line"><span class="nc">.floating-box</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="n">box</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">shadow</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">5px</span> <span class="m">5px</span> <span class="m">5px</span> <span class="m">#ccc</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Now the panel has a nice drop shadow which should make it easier on the eyes and easier to see the 3D effect.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2011/02/demo6.png" width="628" height="312" title="'3DS screen with plain background and a green panel overlaid with a drop shadow'" /></p>

<p>But how does it get rendered so that each eye sees the shadow differently?</p>

<h3 id="seeing-the-light">Seeing the light</h3>

<p>The way I see it there are two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The browser provides a default (override-able) light source:</li>
</ol>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>CSS    </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="css"><span class="line"><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="n">light</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">25</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="m">25</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">fixed</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p><code>fixed</code> would position the light source relative to the browser viewport, and as an alternative <code>absolute</code> would position it relative to the document.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You, the developer, get granular control over what each eye sees:</li>
</ol>

<p>If you had control over each eye the possibilities would be endless. Set the difference in box shadow offset, show a different background image to achieve a rippling effect. You would OWN all the dimensions.</p>

</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I think a combination of both would probably be in the interests of developer and user alike.</p>

<h3 id="its-not-all-giant-blue-humanoids-and-bio-luminescent-flowers">It’s not all giant blue humanoids and bio-luminescent flowers</h3>

<p>This technology has it’s disadvantages, and you can be sure that there will be some nasty surprises out there when it comes along. As with most visual effects, subtlety is king. Of course there will always be the developers who are irresponsible with this great power and make some eye-bleeding creations, but that’s just inevitable. No, what I’m really worried about can be summed up in two words: Internet. Advertising. If you thought pop-over ads were intrusive now, you ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>

<h3 id="the-waiting-game">The waiting game</h3>

<p>Who knows what you’ll be able to do with the browser? Nintendo maybe? Or if it’s <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> providing the software again, as they did for the Wii and original DS/DSi then I expect they will know. (Please do get in touch if you have insider knowledge!) But until that information is made available or the 3DS is in our hands we won’t know for sure. I hope it’s got at least a few fun 3D features to play with. I’m sure the full set will develop over time.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Now that the browser is available, I had a little play with it and <a href="/blog/2011/06/14/3ds-browser-revisited/">wrote down a few of my thoughts</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>…unless you are specifically on another subdomain. </p>

<p>I’m not kidding! You need to make sure that your sites all redirect from http://yoursite.org to http://www.yoursite.org. If you’re not sure whether your sites do this, try now. Go ahead, I’ll wait.</p>

<p>You can score yourself against this list based on what you see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Error page: <strong>NO POINTS!</strong></li>
  <li>Redirected to www.yoursite.org but to the front page instead of the page you wanted: <strong>Half a point</strong></li>
  <li>Page served, URL still has no www: <strong>1 point</strong></li>
  <li>Redirected to www.yoursite.org and to the correct page: <strong>10 points!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>On no account should a user see an error page if they don’t type www before your URL. That’s just a horrible experience and most people will think the site is just broken and go somewhere else. No points at all.</p>

<p>It’s almost as bad if the user enters an address to a page within your site and then gets taken to the home page, even if the URL in the address bar says www. I mean at least the site doesn’t look broken but it’s still not a nice welcome. Having the www gets you half a point.</p>

<p>If the page is served irrespective of whether there is a www in the URL thats… OK. But only OK. Aside from the fact that you’ve got the same pages in two locations (not good for Google-juice) it could lead to errors. As yoursite.org and www.yoursite.org are seen as two different domains, if you have any AJAX on your site that refers specifically to www.yoursite.org it’s going to <em>fail hard</em> if the URL in the address bar doesn’t have the www. This is thanks to the cross-domain security model browsers employ. You don’t want that happening.</p>

<p>What you should be doing is simply redirecting all traffic to the root domain to the www subdomain and maintaining the rest of the URL to ensure a good experience. This is actually very easy to do:</p>

<p>Open the <code>.htaccess</code> file in the root of your site’s file structure. If it doesn’t exist, create it! You can create it on the command line, or directly on the server but Windows and OS X will object to the filename if you try and create it using the GUI. Once it’s open, add these lines to it:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="line"><span class="nb">RewriteCond</span> %{HTTP_HOST} ^yoursite\.org$ [NC]
</span><span class="line"><span class="nb">RewriteRule</span> ^(.*)$ http://www.yoursite.org/$1 [R=301,L]
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Note that on the first line when you change the domain you need to add a slash before each dot as it’s part of a regular expression.</p>

<p>It’s that simple!</p>

<p>You have no excuse now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s something that I’ve come up against several times and each time I google for it I turn up a different result.</p>

<p>How do you validate an email address?</p>

<p>Obviously you want to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>, but given the specification for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address">email address</a>es that’s going to be one really complicated line of code.</p>

<p>Following a user’s complaint that they could not register with our site with their (perfectly legitimate) address because of our validation, today’s search yielded more success than usual. Near the bottom of the <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/RJBS/Email-Valid-0.184/lib/Email/Valid.pm">source</a> of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rjbs/Email-Valid-0.184/lib/Email/Valid.pm">Perl Email::Valid module</a> there is a very long regular expression which I have lifted directly and placed in this page.</p>

<p>I won’t lie to you: I haven’t dissected it to manually confirm that it does what it should, but it has been successful so far in the tests I’ve thrown at it. It also works in Javascript which, for me, is a massive win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rugbymadgirl/2528751423/in/pool-pubstandards"><img class="center" src="/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/hBeer.jpg" width="280" height="420" title="'hBeer'" /></a></p>

<p>Seriously? Why do we need to spend hundreds of pounds, dollars, euros or whatever to attend these events? They are pretty pricey and more often that not they are nowhere near home so you have the added cost of transport and hotel bills and all those meals you’re going to consume out while you’re away. It’s not cheap, and even if you can afford it, why spend it?</p>

<h3 id="the-talks-its-all-about-the-presentations--sessions">The Talks… it’s all about the presentations &amp; sessions!</h3>

<p>Is it really though? These people who get on the stage and talk: Yeah OK, they’re great. They do a fantastic presentation, insightful with great slides and funny too! But don’t they put articles on their blogs for free that cover that topic and a wealth of others besides, all year round? If hearing and seeing them actually say the words is so integral to getting their message across, they could very easily record themselves and publish it in a video or audio format right there on their blogs.</p>

<p>In fact, recently some conferences have taken to publishing all the talks that are given right there on the web for all to see. Everyone can watch, even people who didn’t pay to go to the conference itself! I was watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/build">the videos</a> from a conference that I didn’t go to - <a href="http://buildconference.com">Build</a> - which was held in Belfast at the end of last year. How nice of them to go to all the effort of filming it, editing it and putting it online, I thought. And the talks are great, I’d encourage you to go and watch them. But I was thinking… how would I feel about this if I actually PAID to go to the conference?</p>

<h3 id="money-talks">Money talks</h3>

<p>If I’d laid down cold hard cash to see the talks, wouldn’t I be unhappy that others who hadn’t could then just browse to a page and see all the content… for free? Maybe a little. But then again I’m all for sharing information and content, especially when it’s of benefit to the community so maybe I’d be a little conflicted about that.</p>

<p>Most people I ask, however, seem not to mind this sort of behaviour. They seem to think that conferences go beyond the talks, and I’d be inclined to agree.</p>

<h3 id="its-not-about-what-you-know">It’s not about what you know</h3>

<p>I think that while the talks are nice and all, what most people value the most from conferences is the opportunity to meet other like-minded people. Or to put it in business-speak: networking. Between the talks and in the evening(s), you get to mingle with people who all have their own goals, ideas, methods, questions and accomplishments in the same field as you and are quite willing to share them with you. The more people you talk to and the more conferences you go to (where you’re likely to see these people again) the more contacts and even friends you are likely to make.</p>

<p>Nothing drives this home more clearly than the general chatter I picked up from this years <a href="http://sxsw.com">SXSW</a> which I was sadly unable to attend. Essentially, the vast majority of talk I picked up from SXSW was not about the panels and talks (which no doubt were excellent) but they were about the parties, BBQs and the socialising. The Networking.</p>

<p>But this brings me back to my original point. Why do we need conferences? If all we need to make contacts is to get people who are in similar lines of work to talk to each other why don’t we do it all the time? The talks are nice but completely unnecessary to get what people seem to value the most from conferences.</p>

<h3 id="pub-standards">Pub Standards</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.pubstandards.co.uk">Pub Standards</a> is something that happens in London on a monthly basis. It also happens in <a href="http://pubstandards.org">Melbourne</a>, I believe (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aliasd/Pub_Standards">Wikipedia confirms this</a> so it must be true). What it is is this: a whole bunch of web folk get together and take over a pub for an evening. They sit and drink and talk about whatever they please which may or may not include topics such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What they are doing at work</li>
  <li>What they are watching on TV</li>
  <li>The contents of that controversial blog post that’s been doing the rounds on Twitter</li>
  <li>The latest CSS tricks that they’ve learned or seen in action</li>
  <li>Why anyone who uses a Palm Pre should be hugged / pitied / unfollowed / shot on sight</li>
  <li>Anything and everything else</li>
</ul>

<p>…you get the idea. It sounds pretty much like the after party at a conference then.</p>

<p>The other night it was in fact my first Pub Standards (for shame) but it certainly won’t be my last. I just can’t imagine why this hasn’t caught on more places than just London and Melbourne!</p>

<h3 id="the-reality">The reality</h3>

<p>While it would be awesome to think that we could all get our conference fix by reading blogs, watching online video and going to Pub Standards the reality is that it’s just not logistically possible.</p>

<p>There are actually people outside of London (and indeed outside of any large city) who are involved in the web industry who just couldn’t make it in to the city on a regular basis. They could start their own group but you really need a large city environment to get a decent sized and varied bunch of people together each month. In addition to that, conferences can provide the chance for people to meet developers from other parts of the country or from the other side of the world which local meet-ups just can’t.</p>

<p>It would be nice to think that we might be able to organise some kind of International Pub Standards where people fly in and join the fun for a few times every year, but that wouldn’t work for so many reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spouses and significant others often remain unconvinced of the value of developers drinking beer together.</li>
  <li>No one’s going to fly in from Amsterdam just for a night out at the pub - it has to be for longer to make it worth it.</li>
  <li>Any longer than an evening and you start having to take things like food breaks and accommodation into account… and the conversation could start to need a catalyst of some sort.</li>
  <li>No company is going to pay your transatlantic flights for what can only be described as a night down the pub with a bunch of geeks.</li>
</ol>

<p>The talks that you get at a conference and the information you glean from them, or the questions that arise from them seem to solve all these problems quite neatly. And let’s face it they generally are quite good, otherwise they wouldn’t bother making them available for everyone else on the internet.</p>

<h3 id="is-that-your-final-answer">Is that your final answer?</h3>

<p>Why do we need conferences? It’s so we can meet people and gel as a community on a global level in a way that you can’t do by just using Twitter, Facebook and all of their social contemporaries.</p>

<p>But let’s not underestimate the value of local groups either. I find it astounding that Pub Standards is only happening in London and Melbourne. There must be so many places, large cities, where there are plenty enough web developers interested in Standards and beer to get a regular meet-up going. If you live or work in one of them, why not start one up? I’m sure it would be very rewarding on many levels.</p>
