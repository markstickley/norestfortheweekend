Mainly because I don't use them too often, here are a few useful commands for Octopress:

* `rake new_post["title"]`
* `rake generate` (creates markup from markdown and templates)
* `rake watch` (generates when changes are detected in SASS or source)
* `rake preview` (watches, and starts a webserver on port 4000)
* `rake deploy` (publishes)
